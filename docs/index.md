This is the daulric's personal website.

Ulric also known as daulric is a intermediate programmer that does all kinds of shit. idc

Languages I like:

- Lua
- Python
- Javascript

I tried programming in Java but shiiit that was the most annoying programming language I've ever used

!!! note

    I hate `php` and `html`. Html and is very mid.

    As a matter of fact, no one uses html as they are moving to much more easier and suitable languages like React, Vue or Angular.

    Some people need `php`; idk the reason for that but that their stress.
