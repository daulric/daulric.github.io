* ### ^^RoTops^^

A military training facility that was designed to help military group train for raids. I made this game for a SEA Military Division, but the owner had the audacity to shut down the group.

Im still friends with the owner of SEA Military. You should check out his game; Navy Simulator. Not gonna link it because that's free advertisement. I need that bread.

This was a lame game, but to me, it was well designed. R$10,000 and the game is yours.
